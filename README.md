# What is Txt2tags? 

##You may have heard about Txt2tags, if you have it's a good thing.
**Txt2tags means that your website is being built correctly.. by professionals.**

In the past you may have heard of [WYSIWYG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) (what you see is what you get) formatting. Think of Txt2tags like a simplified WYSIWYG ... simplified in the best way.

When web designers and developers approach a project, they build [styles](http://www.w3schools.com/css/) into the project.  
Those styles dictate how basic elements, like headers and links, will appear.

In the past, a WYSIWYG editing tool had too much control. Someone could unknowingly add a new style to the design (like red italic bold headers) without meaning to. More often than not, it was a purposeful addition, but that leads to a *race to the bottom*, so style treatment became larger, bolder, and brighter. This makes designers sad :( because their carefully crafted theme is tossed by the wayside, like stuff ... old stuff.

Bottom line, people who edit content should focus on the words and the designer should make them pretty. Txt2tags does an excellent job at drawing a line in the sand, equipping us to all play nice together. The neat part is that when a designer pushes a new style to your website, it is consistently reflected across the whole chalupa, so they keep the design fresh and stay on top of browser caveats and features. (Dropshadow anyone?)

Txt2tags is widely accepted by [developers and editors](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ie=UTF-8&ion=1&safe=on#hl=en&safe=active&sclient=psy-ab&q=love+Txt2tags&oq=love+Txt2tags&aq=f&aqi=g-v1&aql=1&gs_l=hp.3..0i15.71l18176l0l18448l22l21l1l0l0l0l375l3026l10j7j0j4l23l0.pfwe.1.&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=841a85abab3be8d1&ion=1&biw=1155&bih=1017), so it's the best choice for implementing best practice. Nearly every popular content management solution supports Txt2tags, if not out-of-the-box, then with an easy-to-install extension.

##Txt2tags tools (this is the good stuff)

**Anyone who works with content should be using one of the following tools...**
*Note: Everything about Txt2tags is free, paid stuff is totally optional and often worse.*

- If you want to turn a website into Txt2tags, then its easy to do with [html2text](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/html2text/), or by using the [make.text bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/dajare/5371948) (also see [Marky](http://Txt2tagsrules.com/))
- I really like using [gist](https://gist.github.com/) by github for sharing and collaborating (called forking) on documents. [Here's a sample](https://gist.github.com/2152688) :P

####Other

- (Mac) [Marked](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?mt=12) ($3.99) provides a preview of your (Multi)Txt2tags as you work in any text editor.


##How do I write this Txt2tags stuff?
When developers talk about how to write something, they call it syntax.  
To that end, here are related syntax documents sorted by ease of use.

- [SquareSpace](http://www.squarespace.com/display/ShowHelp?section=Txt2tags) - Formatting guide
- [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/Txt2tags/syntax) - The original guide by the author

##Huh?

[Txt2tags](http://daringfireball.net/projects/Txt2tags/) was made by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/), and he says..

> Txt2tags is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Txt2tags allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

##I still don't understand

Txt2tags can be written in a basic text editor (don't use Word) like Notepad on Windows. Macs don't have a basic built-in text editor, but that's what the tools I mentioned above are for. You can write or copy and paste, but it's an easy way to write text that can quickly be turned into HTML. The web is written in HTML, so think of it like quick-start web developing for content editors. When you write in Txt2tags, you save the document with the file extension `.md`. More often than not, you'll never need to save a Txt2tags document, because you'll be using online tools.

##Around the web

* [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/) uses Txt2tags for posts and comments. Here's their [help guide](http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help).
* [github.com](https://github.com) uses a custom blend "GitHub Flavored Txt2tags" for their discussions. Here's their [help guide](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-Txt2tags/).
* [Dustin Curtis](http://dcurt.is/the-Txt2tags-mark) said *"I'm making something that uses Txt2tags, and there's currently no great universal symbol for identifying Txt2tags support. [So I created one](https://github.com/dcurtis/Txt2tags-mark)."* That's the icon up above:  ![Txt2tags symbol](https://raw.github.com/dcurtis/Txt2tags-mark/master/png/32x20-solid.png "Txt2tags symbol")

##Oh yah...

- I really want [Txt2tags extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-Txt2tags/extra/) to be more prevalent. It is the future of Txt2tags. If you can develop using Txt2tags Extra, please do. If possible, upgrade your Txt2tags installs to Txt2tags Extra. And don't forget about [Smartypants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) if you want Txt2tags Extra to got the extra mile (also [available for PHP](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-smartypants/)).
- [Textile](http://textile.sitemonks.com/) is great, and was probably used most by [37 Signals](http://productblog.37signals.com/products/2007/07/use-textile-in-.html), but it lost the battle in the end.  
It did have out-of-the-box support for tables, though, which was quite nice.
>Textile is a lightweight markup language originally developed by Dean Allen and billed as a "humane web text generator". Textile converts its marked-up text input to valid, well-formed XHTML and also inserts character entity references for apostrophes, opening and closing single and double quotation marks, ellipses and em dashes
